## Topic: Analyzing CTA Bus Reliability

Why I'm Interested in this topic: As someone who takes public transit frequently and experienced bus delays,
I was curious to dive deeper into the frequency of bus delays and factors that contribute to it. <br />

Thoughts on using this data: I hope to use the compilation of data sources to highlight
connections between traffic congestion, bus routes, and trends in ridership and analyze
CTA's bus routes and how well they service the public. <br />

Potential data points: riders per route, riders per region, routes per region,
bus route/ridership variation with holidays <br />

Any concerns about the data: I'm not sure if I'll be able to get bus-delay specific
information from this - I may need to use an API from CTA to do so. <br />
