            <h1>"Ghost Buses": Exploring the Scope and Impact 
                of Delayed Buses in Chicago Public Transit</h1>
            <p>
                Chicago is home to the second largest public transit 
                system in the U.S., averaging approximately 540,000
                rides across bus and rail services daily. As with other 
                city transit systems during the pandemic, Chicago
                experienced a decline in ridership. Source:

            </p>
            <p>
                Since the city has been transitioning to the "new normal" and ridership
                is slowly recovering, more transit riders have been experiencing
                what is informally known as "ghost buses", or buses that
                are delayed or simply do not show up. This has led to increased
                frustration amongst public transit users and calls for action, 
                accountability, and transparency from the Chicago Transit Authority
                (CTA). This project aims to explore and visualize
                the potential causes behind "ghost buses" in Chicago.

        <h1>Total Bus Rides Per Year</h1>
        <p>
            The bus ridership totals have sharply declined with the onset of the
            pandemic. This chart represents ridership data from
            the City of Chicago Data Portal from January 1, 2018 up
            until July 31, 2022. The amount of times that people boarded 
            a bus was counted daily and then aggregated at the annual level. Source:

        <h1>Proportion of Delayed Bus Intervals</h1>
        <p>
            Bus delays can often be observed by the phenomenon called "bus bunching", 
            where multiple buses on the same route/line arrive back to back. Transit 
            planners try to account for this by scheduling timed intervals 
            between bus arrivals. However, even a one minute delay or head start can 
            throw off a whole series of scheduled intervals, which can 
            intensify bus delays. Sometimes, transit planners will address this by
            cutting short or cancelling a bus's trip, leading to a "ghost bus". 
        </p>
        <p>
            One way to understand the extent of bus delays is to look at the discrepancy
            between scheduled bus intervals and actual bus intervals. An interval is
            defined as the time that passes between two consecutive buses on the same
            route. This chart shows the proportion of bus intervals that are greater 
            than the scheduled gap and greater than 15 minutes. Source:

                CTA Performance Metrics</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, in June 2022, the CTA stated that 13.3% of bus intervals
            for that month were longer than their scheduled gap and greater than 
            15 minutes. Since the CTA did not provide totals, we can try to understand
            this by looking at the chart for June 2022. For every 100 scheduled bus
            intervals, approximately 13 of those were longer than the scheduled gap.
            It is important to note that the CTA aims to only have 4% of intervals 
            in this category, and they have been consistently over this threshold for the
            past year.

        <h1>Total Number of Bus-Related Employees Per Year</h1>
        <p>
            The CTA has cited a bus operator and employee shortage as one of the leading
            causes of the uptick in bus delays. This chart shows the total amount of 
            CTA employees who work within any division related to buses 
            during 2018 - 2022. While there has been a decline in the number of 
            employees during the pandemic, we cannot definitely draw a causal
            relationship between this decline and the severity of bus delays. Source:

                Authority Mapping and Statistics</a>

        <div id="bar_chart"></div>

        <h1>Revenue Breakdown Per Year</h1>
        <p>
            This chart shows the proportion of different revenue streams (in thousands
            of dollars) for the CTA during 2018 - 2022. The data for 2022 is only up 
            until August 2022. Given that the fall in ridership has negatively impacted
            revenue, the CTA is calling for additional emergency funding from Congress.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            While there are numerous causes of transit and bus delays, the pandemic
            has exacerbated the impact of bus delays on transit riders. In addition,
            CTA's response to service cuts and bus delays has been slow. Even if the CTA's path
            to improved transit service and overall rider experience is long, riders
            still demand accountability, transparency, and communication. And if these
            trends of delays and service cuts continue, where does that leave the 
            future of the CTA and public transit in Chicago?
