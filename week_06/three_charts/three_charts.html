        <h1>Police Shootings by Race</h1>
        <p>
            This bar chart groups the data to show the number of
            shootings by race. A bar chart was used so that the 
            number of shootings by race could be easily compared. 
            It would have been helpful to also incorporate
            the population proportion of each racial group; we see
            that in this dataset, there were a higher number of white 
            people who died in a police shooting. However, given that
            they make up the majority of the population, we cannot conclude
            from this graph that white people are more likely to be shot and killed
            by a police officer.

        <h1>Police Shootings by Month</h1>
        <p>
            This chart groups the number of police shootings that occurred in 
            each month of 2015. A line chart was used to see if there were any 
            trends in the number of police shootings throughout the year. Additional
            helpful information could have been if there were any significant events
            that happened during certain months that could impact a person's likelihood
            of getting killed by the police.

        <h1>Police Shootings by Age</h1>
        <p>
            This chart is a histogram of the distribution of police shootings by age.
            A histogram was used to show the age groups most impacted by police
            shootings. It would have been more meaningful to interlay this information
            with gender, race, and socioeconomic status so that we could have a more
            intersectional, holistic picture.
