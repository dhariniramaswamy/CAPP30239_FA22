        <h1>Police Shootings by Age</h1>
        <p>
            This chart is a histogram of the distribution of police shootings by age.
            A histogram was used to show the age groups most impacted by police
            shootings. It would have been more meaningful to interlay this information
            with gender, race, and socioeconomic status so that we could have a more
            intersectional, holistic picture.
